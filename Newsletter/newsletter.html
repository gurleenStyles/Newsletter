    <th align="left"><p id="paragraph">Engaging in brain exercises, such as completing a sudoku puzzle, enhances cognitive abilities, boosts memory, and promotes overall mental well-being. We all experience mental fog occasionally, but factors like stress, aging, inadequate sleep, or an unhealthy lifestyle can intensify this cognitive haze, affecting memory, problem-solving skills, and overall cognitive function.To help your brain stay sharp and focused, here are nine well-researched exercises and games to consider.

        1. Learning a new languageLearning a new language offers numerous benefits for the brain:
        
        - *Improves cognitive functions*
        
        - *Enhances memory*
        
        - *Boosts problem-solving skills*
        
        Using language learning apps or online courses provides a structured and convenient approach to acquiring a new language. A 2018 study found that bilingualism can lead to changes in brain structure, especially in areas showing increased neural reserve, which helps cope with age-related cognitive decline and maintains cognitive functions.</p></th>

            <th align="left"><p id="paragraph">Navigating a job interview can be a nerve-wracking experience, but former Google recruiter Nolan Church offers valuable insights to help candidates make a lasting impression. While it's essential to showcase enthusiasm and confidence, Church emphasizes the importance of avoiding certain behaviours that could potentially hinder your chances of securing the position, CNBC reported.One common pitfall to steer clear of is the temptation to respond to questions about areas for improvement with clichÃ©d phrases like "I work too hard" or "I'm a perfectionist." According to Church, such responses can come across as disingenuous and may raise doubts about your authenticity. Instead, he advises candidates to embrace vulnerability by sharing genuine examples of past mistakes, demonstrating a willingness to learn and grow.

                Remember, "I'm not hiring you to be perfect. I'm hiring you to grow with us," he said
                Additionally, Church advises against speaking negatively about former colleagues, managers, or organizations. Blaming others for shortcomings reflects poorly on your character and may suggest a lack of accountability. Instead, take ownership of your actions and highlight how you've learned from past experiences, showcasing humility and a commitment to personal development.</th>

A former Googler Nolan Church, who recruited for the company, revealed the most common resume blunders that can ruin the chances of even getting a response from recruiters. He also listed some tips and tricks to take advantage of while looking for jobs at big companies.n a recent LinkedIn post, Church shared his unfiltered thoughts on the matter saying: "Most resumes suck." But he's not just doling out criticism; he's also got some advice to help potential Googlers navigate the treacherous waters of job applications.

                    In a conversation with CNBC, Church claimed that the number one red flag that will make him hit the "delete" button faster than you can say "algorithm" is what he calls "text bricks." These are those endless, mind-numbing streams of text that might have a lot of words but lack any real substance. According to Church, if your resume looks like a novel, there's "zero chance you're going to move forward." 
                    So, what's the secret to catching the attention of recruiters? According to Church, one should keep the resume concise and to the point. Church suggests using short, one-line bullets under each job description. Don't go overboard with "three to four sentences per bullet" because, let's face it, ain't nobody got time for that in today's fast-paced, emoji-driven world of communication.</th>
